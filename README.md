# Relativistic Travel Calculator for AstroSynthesis
https://www.nbos.com/products/astrosynthesis

A plugin to calculate travel distance/time between two points, as observed by the travelling object and an external stationary observer. Speed is set as a fraction of c (speed of light), and can have any value between 0 and 1 (exclusive).

Select any two points and run the plugin, where you can then set a desired speed. Select 'Ok' to then calculate relativistic travel information. Note, a speed of 0.7c is approximately the 'break even' point.
